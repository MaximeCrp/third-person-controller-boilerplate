# Godot 4 - Third Person Controller Boilerplate

This example repository is meant to kick-start any 3rd person controller game in Godot 4 without having to recreate all the bases.

This was developed following the awesome [Godot 4.0 Third Person Controller Tutorial ( 2023 )](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EP5AYllgHy8) video tutorial by Lukky.

Assets are from [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/#/).
